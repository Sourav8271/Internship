      "Great video! As an established data scientist myself, this is definitely an accurate data science project lifecycle; however, I almost never go through all of these steps in the same day. You can spend whole days just cleaning data, tuning models, or putting things into production. The work that you do can also vary by company, some data scientists only work on part of that lifecycle just doing exploration and modeling or modeling and productionization. I have a few videos on my channel that complement this one nicely for those interested!\n",
      "So, i watched this video, and im even more confused as to wtf a data scientist actually is\n",
      "This is really a very clear presentation of what really goes with a data science project from the very beginning. However, things do not happen very easily. There are a lot of challenges that you have to deal with. In data cleaning alone, the time that you use can be overwhelming.\n",
      "it was a great overview of all the process.  it would be great if we get more videos on DATA PREPARATION, EDA. various methods\n",
      "for different scenarios.\n",
      "A nice capture of the top level elements, thank you! It easily gets convoluted, and I was looking reflect on a simple overview.\n",
      "Your videos are what is getting me the necessary introduction to data science. Thank you so much!\n",
      "Excellent video, I think I've got it now.  Data Science is when someone is a BA and is also a peddler for particular software or applications.\n",
      "A very interesting intro to data science. I want to learn the step data cleaning more deeply. It would be very helpful if you could make a vedio on that. Thanks!\n",
      "Thank you for this super interesting video! :)\n",
      "I would like to ask you something: Which are the most important skills that a data analyst should have/learn?\n",

      "Data science explained in such a clean and brilliant manner!! Thank you for the awesome video!!\n",
      "Great video. You did great explaining this. That said, I would argue that it can never be overstated how extremely rigorous you must be in the earliest steps. Specifically data acquisition and cleaning. Mistakes in these steps will often corrupt every subsequent step in your research. Furthermore, it is these earliest steps that are the hardest if not impossible to correct if mistakes are found. Do some field work, say NSF or an FFRDC gives you 2 million dollars for it. Go out into the field and unknowingly bring the wrong brand of batteries for your solar panels that you don’t figure out until your back? Oh well. This seemingly tiny and innocent mistake turns a long lived project of monitoring an area into a very short lived one when the battery dies. All the clocks on your instruments are not correctly synced by gps and you have timing errors now? Now we have absolutely horrible data that needs to be cleaned! THE FIRST TWO STEPS (ACQUISITION AND CLEANING) ARE SO IMPORTANT!!!!!\n",

This is a separate business and we don’t have any affiliation with them. \\n\\nWHAT TO EXPECT:\\n*Our Standards are in line with the accommodation type we offer (BUDGET HOSTEL). The NX London is not a Hotel, the shared nature of our dormitory rooms might occasionally result into clutter. Bathrooms are located in the hallways and partaken with other guests, some wait-time might be required on peak times. \\n*In order to maintain our prices low, we kept \"on location amenities\" to a minimum: There are no toiletries, air conditioning and/or a mini-bar in the rooms. We feature a mix of long term and leisure guests, this gives the ambience a uniquely quirky character, as a consequence it would be impossible to meet everybody\\'s taste. Discriminatory comments or behavior won\\'t be tolerated.\\n*Our 10 bed dorm can host up to 10 guests! If you\\'re not comfortable sharing the space with that many people (and their belongings) please consider booking a different dorm or request an upgrade with price difference (subject to availability). \\n* The hostel is primarily designed for adults and we expect our guests to act in a responsible and respectful manner at all times. \\n* Upon reserving, you agree and acknowledge that our staff is trained to enforce our policies and procedures in a firm and assertive manner, holding everybody to a high standard of behavior and with zero-tolerance policy for any breaches. If they instruct you to follow a particular rule or procedure, we kindly request that you comply with their directions. We ask that guests understand that repeated breaches of policy can put a strain on our staff. \\n* Being uncomfortable with a high level of enforcement or the manner in which our staff members communicate shall not constitute grounds for a complain.\\n\\nADDITIONAL INFORMATION:\\n*Reception ONLY opens 4:00pm to 1:00am. \\n*Property is not wheelchair accessible*\\n*We do not accept customers over 65 years old unless they are part of a group staying in a private room. We reserve the right to refuse your accommodation at any stage according to the manager discretion. \\n *Groups of 9 guests or more need to send group request.\\n* Check-in time is from 4:00pm-1:00am. Guests arriving between 1:00am-3:00am need to email at least 24hrs in advance to confirm their reservation, pay their late arrival fee and fill out the required online check in form in order not to be be considered a no show.\\nPlease note that in case of no-show, the underlining reservation would be forfeited in accordance to policy (where an applicable 100% cancelation fee shall apply) Any new booking resulting from a no-show would be subject to availability and a £20 re-booking fee. If you fail to pre-arrange late check in or arrive by 1:00am the reservation will be considered a no show with applicable charges.\\n*No-Shows and Early check-outs will always result into a full (100%) charge and shall never constitute basis for a monetary refund regardless of circumstances. A transferable courtesy credit voucher, to be redeemed at our property might be offered at the Manager\\'s discretion.\\n*We DO require a valid ID for all arrivals including UK/EU residents. Expired ones or without a clear or damaged photo are not valid to check-in. \\n*A refundable £10.00 Key Deposit shall be required upon arrival.\\nShould loss of any key reasonably require a locksmith to be called and/or locksmith services to be carried out, guests shall be liable for any locksmith\\'s fees.\\nUpon departure guests should use the express check-out box located by the entrance to drop their key sets, where the corresponding deposit would be refunded directly to the payment method on file for the booking.
